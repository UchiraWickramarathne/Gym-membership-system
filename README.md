# Gym-membership-system
C programming project

## Project Description
The Gym Membership Management System is a C programming project developed during my first year, first semester course. The system allows gyms to efficiently manage their members' details, including adding, editing, and deleting member information. It also categorizes members based on their BMI and handles membership details. The project demonstrates the use of file handling in C for persistent data storage.
